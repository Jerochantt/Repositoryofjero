This is a Monte Carlo simulation of the beheaviors of two immicible liquids at different tempreatures. A ten by ten matrix array filled with 0s and 1s is a visual representation of a container containing the two species of liquids. Molecules of species A are represented by 0s while molecules of species B are represented by 1s. The simulation is coded to simulate base on stastistical mechanics laws and concepts such as entropy, Boltzmann distribution and energy of the molecules. The visulisation plots attained form the simulation shows that immicible liquids saparate at low temperatures and mix more homogeniously at higher temperatures.
